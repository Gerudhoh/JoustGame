# JoustGame

Uses Node.js

Run "npm install" to get all the dependencies
Run "npm start" to open up a webpage with the project at localhost:8080

IDEAS:
~local multiplayer game
~one player controls with wasd, one person with arrows
~attack with some sort of attack button
~character select screen, with different stats (strength, speed, cool stuff)
~have it in some kind of arena
~jousting?
    -Maybe have something where each player mashes a button to speed up the horse by a certain value
    -Once they get close enough perhaps have them time a button press to lower their lance
    -Whoever has better timing does more damage to the other person
~possible upgrades
~swordfighting on horses?
~maybe implement some kind of story at the end

# JoustGame

## How to run this program
This program uses nodeJS to run, make sure you have it installed beforehand.

In the repo directory, run "npm install" to get all the dependencies and create node_modules.
Once that is done, run "npm start" to open up a webpage with the project at localhost:8080. Should open up automatically.

## Ideas
- local multiplayer game
- one player controls with wasd, one person with arrows
- attack with some sort of attack button
- character select screen, with different stats (strength, speed, cool stuff)
- have it in some kind of arena
- jousting
    - Maybe have something where each player mashes a button to speed up the horse by a certain value
    - Once they get close enough perhaps have them time a button press to determine their strength
    - Whoever has better timing and has a faster speed wins
- possible upgrades
- swordfighting
    - Whoever depletes the other person's HP the most wins
- maybe implement some kind of story at the end
